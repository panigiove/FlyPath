# FlyPath

Drone implementad by FlyPath

## Modes

- **Default (boring) mode**, the drone behaves as described in the protocol file.

- **Spicy mode**, the drone sends themed messages to the simulation controller in response to commands or events.

- **BrainRot mode**, the drone has completely lost it. After watching countless hours of Chinese Tiktok Lives and all the episodes of *Skibidi toilet* on YouTube, its brain has melted. The drone is now dangerous: it corrupts packets, disrupts the Flood Protocol, sends random and meme message to the controller, and outright refuses to crash.
